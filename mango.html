		<p>	Mango is native to southern Asia, especially Burma and eastern India. 
			It spreads early on to Malaya, eastern Asia and eastern Africa. Mangoes are
			grown throughout the tropics, from the Caribbean to Africa, South-East Asia, 
			Australia, as well as India, where the history of the fruit goes back over 6,000
			years and closely connected to the Hindu religion. As long ago as the 16th 
			century, mangoes had been distributed via cultivation 
			throughout the Indian subcontinent, and eventually to all tropical regions 
			of the world.

			<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
			According to WebMD website, there are a lot of raisons to love mangoes, among others:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Mangoes may help whittle your middle<br>
			They may seem more like a decadent dessert than a healthy fruit, but mangoes are diet-friendly. 
			Because they are naturally sweet, 
			eating them can help quash your cravings for candy or other sugary foods. A one-cup serving of fresh mango has 
			100 calories, and because that same serving has three grams of filling fiber, you will feel fuller on fewer calories. In fact, mangoes are 83% water by weight, 
			and research from Penn State University has shown that eating foods that have a high water content (and lower energy density) help to keep 
			you fuller while eating less. In fact, one of their studies found that eating a piece of fruit before a meal reduced the calories consumed at that meal by 15 percent.
			</li><br>
			<li>
				They pack a powerful nutrition punch<br>
				Bursting with over 20 vitamins and minerals, mangoes are loaded with good nutrition and health benefits. 
				Just one cup provides 100% of our daily vitamin C needs, helping to strengthen our immune system, keep our 
				teeth and gums healthy, and support collagen formation–hello, beautiful skin! Mangoes are also rich in fiber,
				a nutrient that helps you to fill up, not weigh you down.

				<strong> Mango Lassi</strong> <br><br>
				Author Notes: The inspiration for this recipe comes from the mango lassi: the rich, golden-hued, yogurt-based drink commonly 
				served alongside Indian curries to act as a sort of culinary fire extinguisher. At home, we usually serve lassis as a dessert, 
				so I thought: why not take it a step further and really turn it into dessert? And mango lassi 
				frozen yogurt was born!

				<p>A couple of notes on the ingredients: <br><br>
				My mango pulp comes pre-sweetened (not drastically, but still). If you're starting with unsweetened 
					pulp, you may want to increase the sugar by a tablespoon or two.<br><br>
				 Using a fuller-fat yogurt like whole milk yogurt will add richness and help prevent your 
				frozen yogurt from freezing rock-hard.</p>

				Makes roughly 1 litre<br>

				2 cups	canned mango pulp (see note above)<br>
				1 cup	plain whole milk yogurt<br>
				1/2 cup	half and half (12.5%) milk<br>
				1/4 cup + 2 tbsp	white sugar<br>
				1 tsp	rosewater (optional)<br><br>
				<p>Place all ingredients in a blender or large bowl and blend/whisk until smooth. If necessary, chill the mixture until super-cold and give it one last 
				whir/stir. Pop chilled lassi mixture into your ice cream machine and freeze according
				to the manufacturers instructions. Once it is done in the machine, transfer frozen yogurt to a freezer-safe container and freeze until it is firmed up to your 
				liking (this might take a few hours). If the frozen yogurt freezes quite hard, give it a few minutes to warm up before you start scooping.</p>

				Mangoes may temper inflammation<br>
				Mangoes contain several anti-inflammatory compounds, including vitamin C and beta carotene. 
				And a recent study published in the journal of Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, found that 
				mango has the potential to enhance the diet as a source of gallic acid and gallotannins which may possess anti-inflammatory 
				and anti-carcinogenic properties.
			</li><br>
			
			<li>
				They are easier to cut and peel than you think<br>
				Stumped about the best way to slice a mango? Just place the fruit on the cutting board stem-end down and hold. 
				Then, take a sharp knife and cut just off-center, about ¼ of an inch.  Repeat on the other side so that you have two 
				mango cheeks. Take the first half and cut parallel slices or a checkerboard pattern into the mango flesh, being careful 
				not to cut through the skin. Scoop the slices or cubes out with a spoon. If you want smaller cubes for a recipe, simply 
				make the cuts closer together. Easy!
			</li><br>
			
			<li>Red does not equal ripe<br>
			A red mango is not always a ripe mango! To know if it is ready to eat, squeeze it gently.
			A ripe mango will give slightly. Like more familiar fruits, such as peaches and avocado, mangoes also become softer 
			as they ripen. If a mango is firmer than desired, set it on the countertop, where it will continue to ripen. To speed up 
			the process, place mangoes in a paper bag at room temperature. Once ripe, mangoes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
