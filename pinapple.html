			Pineapples are tropical fruit that are rich in vitamins, enzymes and antioxidents. 
			They may help boost the immune system, build strong bones and aid indigestion. Also, 
			despite their sweetness, pineapples are low in calories.The pineapple fruit is known 
			to offer several benefits. Pineapple can be added to kebabs, smoothies, and a whole 
			range of salads. Pineapple can be added to kebabs, smoothies, and a whole range of salads.
			Every pineapple has the exact same number of hexagonal sections on it, no matter the size 
			and shape.The name "pineapple" came from European explorers who thought the fruit looked like
			a pinecone with flesh like an apple. Canned pineapple was first made in 1901 but wasn't widely 
			available until engineer Henry Ginaca invented a machine in 1911 that could remove the outer shell, 
			inner core and both ends of 100 pineapples in less than a minute! This machine, known as the 
			"Ginaca machine", is still used in pineapple canneries today. You can't put fresh pineapple in Jell-O
			because the bromelain content prevents gelatin from setting. Canned pineapple, on the other hand, can be 
			added to Jell-O because the canning process destroys the bromelain.
